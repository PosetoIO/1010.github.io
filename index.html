<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>1 cup yellow masarepa (precooked cornmeal)</li>
	  <li>1/2 cup tapioca (cassava, yuca) flour
	  <li>2 cuos grated farmer's cheese, monterey jack, or mozarella</li>
	  <li>2 eggs</li>
	  <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
	  <li>salt to taste</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Preparations</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees</li>
	  <li>Mix the two flours and the sugar in a bowl</li>
	  <li>Stir in the grated cheese and the eggs. Mix well with a wooden spoon. Taste for salt, and add salt as needed.</li>
	  <li>Knead dough until smooth. If the dough seems too dry, add a few teaspoons of milk or buttermilk. The dough should be soft and pliable. Let dough rest for about 10 minutes, covered with plastic wrap.</li>
	  <li>Roll dough into balls that are slightly larger than golf balls. To shape the dough into rings (rosquillas), first roll a piece of dough into a cylinder, then join the ends together to form a circle. The rolls do not have to be perfectly smooth - they will puff up in the last several minutes of baking.</li>
	  <li>Place rolls on a greased cookie sheet and bake for about 20 minutes or until golden in color and puffed.</li>
	  <li>Serve warm.</li>
	</ol>
